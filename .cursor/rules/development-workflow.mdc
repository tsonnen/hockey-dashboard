# Development Workflow

When modifying components or pages, follow this workflow:

## 1. Make Changes

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use co-located structure: `*.tsx`, `*.module.css`, `*.test.tsx`, `index.ts`

## 2. Run Verification

- **Lint**: `pnpm run lint`
- **Build**: `pnpm run build`
- **Unit Tests**: `pnpm run test`
- **E2E Tests**: `pnpm run playwright:test`

## 3. Browser Verification (Required for Component/Page Changes)

**Whenever you modify a component or page**, you MUST delegate to the browser subagent to verify the changes work correctly in a real browser.

### Steps

1. **Start the dev server** (if not already running): `pnpm dev`
2. **Use browser tools** to:
   - Navigate to the affected page(s)
   - Interact with the modified component/feature
   - Confirm the UI renders correctly and behaves as expected
   - Check for console errors or visual regressions

### Browser Workflow

- Use `browser_navigate` to load the page
- Use `browser_snapshot` to inspect the page structure before interacting
- Use `browser_click`, `browser_type`, etc. to exercise the feature
- Use short incremental waits (1–3s) with snapshots rather than long fixed waits

### What to Verify

- **Landing page** (`/`): Date picker, league selector, game cards load
- **Game details** (`/game/nhl/[id]` or `/game/qmjhl/[id]`): Score display, team logos, navigation
- **Team details** (`/team/[league]/[id]`): Schedule, roster, skaters, goalies sections

See `.agent/workflows/modify_component_or_page.md` for the full workflow.
